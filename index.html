                <p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from BRAC University. During my studies, I focused on web development, software engineering, and data structures, which helped me develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills. 
                    In addition to my academic achievements, I completed internships at two renowned companies, where I gained practical experience in front-end development and project management. I have also worked on various personal projects, which further enhanced my coding skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
